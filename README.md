# jQuery - emojipass v1


## Overview

A simple, lightweight jQuery plugin for change the way you input passwords.

## The idea...

The general idea of this plugin is to make password input in your website a little different and at the same time bring more secure passwords for your users. 

When the user picks an image of his desire the UTF-8 character will be input into the password input and those characters after submission will be the ones saved in the databse.
